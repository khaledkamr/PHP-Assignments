## About This Repository

This repository is a compilation of PHP assignments completed as part of my online course. The projects here demonstrate my understanding of core PHP concepts, from fundamental syntax and operations to more advanced topics like data handling, sessions, and object-oriented programming.

Each assignment was designed to address specific PHP challenges and explore practical applications of the language. By working through these exercises, I’ve developed a solid foundation in PHP and improved my ability to create dynamic, server-side applications.

This repository not only serves as a record of my learning journey but is also intended to help others who are learning PHP. I hope these solutions can serve as examples or references for anyone looking to enhance their PHP skills.
